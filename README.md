post-pycon-video-voting
=======================

Every year the Silicon Valley Python Interest Group meets and watches PostPyCon
videos.

There are several events this year:

Beginner's Track:
http://www.meetup.com/silicon-valley-python/events/107293322/

Normal Track:
http://www.meetup.com/silicon-valley-python/events/119476152/

During this event, we vote from a list of videos. A "plus one" vote increases
the video in the list. Anyone can vote as often as they like (until a video has
already been watched).  So, popular videos perculate to the top quickly as a
group.

This year, the app is written in Google App Engine because, frankly, I don't
have a GAE app in my Github account that I could share. Now, I do :)
